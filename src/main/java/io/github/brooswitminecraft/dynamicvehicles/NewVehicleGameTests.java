/**
 * MINECRAFT-380: dev-runtime verification for Motorboat/Chopper/Biplane, run headlessly by {@code
 * ./gradlew runGameTestServer} (the same CI step {@code DispatcherGameTests}' own javadoc documents) --
 * requested by review 5563367455's re-review (comment 48008): the pure {@code MotorboatPhysics}/{@code
 * ChopperPhysics}/{@code BiplanePhysics} unit tests prove the equations, but not that the real entity
 * integrates correctly with Minecraft's own mounting, collision and persistence. These spawn a real
 * entity in a real, ticking {@code ServerLevel}, mount a {@link GameTestHelper#makeMockPlayer} as its
 * driver (reading/writing the exact same public {@code zza}/{@code xxa}/pitch fields a real client's
 * input packets would set, so this is the real control path, not a test-only shortcut), and assert on
 * actual position/onGround/rider state after real ticks.
 *
 * <p>What this does NOT cover, and the javadoc on each test says so again at the point it matters: a
 * second real client (so no genuine two-client rider/observer synchronization or control-handoff
 * evidence), and a true world unload/reload across a server restart (the NBT round-trip test below is a
 * proxy for the save half of that, not the full thing). Both remain open per the ticket/PR.
